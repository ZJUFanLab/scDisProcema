#  Tutorial
  The R package __scDisProcema__ integrates Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) pipline for tracing the dynamic change of gene expression patterns during disease progression using single-cell data.
  
  The workflow of the scDisProcema can be divided into three steps: 1) gene-state matrix as input to WGCNA for gene co-expression network module searching; 2) module dynamic analysis for degree of dynamic change and relevance to cells over the course of disease; 3) key module identification for different cell types.
